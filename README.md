# A Guaranteed Cost Approach to Robust Model Predictive Control of Uncertain Linear Systems

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the robust controller designed for CaRINA autonomous vehicle. 

It contains:
- The source code for the controller and observer synthesis;
- The Simulink model for simulation.

## Pre-requisites

The source code in this repository requires:

- [MATLAB R2016a](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)

## Running the examples

The synthesis and simulation are self contrained. To execute them simply type

```matlab
>> sim_init
>> sim_execute
```

## Citing

The paper is currently being rewritten, this section will be updated once its pre-print is available.
